# Codingpedia bookmarks, aka #codingmarks

(Cu)rated bookmarks for developers. Visit [http://codingmarks.org](http://codingmarks.org) or [https://bookmarks.codingpedia.org](https://bookmarks.codingpedia.org/) to look through the public bookmarks and create your own list.

This project is developed with the MEAN stack, featuring [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/), [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html), [Angular](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/). Authentication and authorization
 is done via [Keycloak](http://www.keycloak.org/) 

There is a **two-step** setup required for development 
* **front-end** concerning angular/angular-cli setup
* **back-end** concerning mongodb, keycloak, node

Here is listed how to setup the front-end part. See [backend-end setup](https://github.com/Codingpedia/bookmarks-api) to complete configuration for local development.

# Front-end

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
